## Issues/Problems

- Some of the colliders fail to trigger a collision event in certain occasions
- Interpreting the requirements of the project was a bit confusing as they are vague in some parts
- When completing a lap, the logic to update the track's color is a bit buggy
- When moving to the next waypoint the autonomous car sometimes gets "confused": this seldom happens tho.
